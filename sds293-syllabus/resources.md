# Resources Supporting SDS 293

Here is a list of additional resources supporting our class. Information about your instructor can be found on the [logistics page](). 

## Inclusivity for all students

Smith is committed to providing support services and reasonable accommodations to all students with disabilities. Please inform me early in the term if there are aspects of the course that need to be modified to serve your learning, health, or person. You may speak with me after class, during student hours, or during an appointment. To request an accommodation, please register with the Disability Services Office at the beginning of the semester. To begin the process, either call 413-585-2071 or email ods@smith.edu.

Students in need of short-term academic advice or support can contact your class dean in the Dean of the College office. If you require some accommodation for religious or cultural purposes, please do not hesitate to let me know. 


## Spinelli Center

The Spinelli Center for Quantitative Learning is a resource to support students as they take STEM courses and as they engage in other quantitative work. To see the list of available peer tutors and other resources available at the Spinelli Center, please consult their [website](https://www.smith.edu/qlc/tutoring.html). 

## Jacobson Center

Smith has an additional resource for writing support: the Jacobson Center for Writing, Teaching & Learning make an appointment to take your work to the Jacobson Center on [their website](https://www.smith.edu/academics/jacobson-center). In particular, you may choose to bring your work to Peer Writing Tutors Elisabeth Nesmith or Elina Gordon-Halpern, both SDS majors who tutor for the Jacobson Center. Contact Sara Eddy (seddy@smith.edu) for more information about their schedules or how to make an appointment.
